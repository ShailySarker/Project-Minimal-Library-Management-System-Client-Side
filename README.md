# Project: Minimal Library Management System(Client Side)

Minimal library management system using React, Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query), and TypeScript. The system will allow users to view a list of books, perform CRUD operations, borrow books, and view a simple borrow summaryâ€”all without authentication, category filters, or payment integration. The main goal is to build a functional and clean client-side application that interacts with a RESTful API, demonstrating proper state management, UI design, and core functionality.
